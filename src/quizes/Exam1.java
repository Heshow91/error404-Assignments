    //create a program which will
    // - take a specific number of student name from the console
    // - for each student, it should ask for 4 subjects name and marks for them all
    // - your code should get the avg marks & total for the each of the students
    // - store all the students name, marks, subjects in individual ArrayList/Hashset and print all subjects, students name from that

    //Tips : You may want to use Scanner, ArrayList, HashSet/ArrayList
    //Your code needs to by dynamic enough to handle as many numbers of student user may want to.
